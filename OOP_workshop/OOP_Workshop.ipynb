    "Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a way of writing programs that represent real-world problem spaces (in terms of objects, functions, classes, attributes, methods, and inheritance). As Allen Downey explains in [__Think Python__](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/html/thinkpython018.html), in object-oriented programming, we shift away from framing the *function* as the active agent and toward seeing the *object* as the active agent.\n",

This tutorial is adapted from content in Anand Chitipothu's [__Python Practice Book__](http://anandology.com/python-practice-book/index.html). It was created by [Rebecca Bilbro](https://github.com/rebeccabilbro/Tutorials/tree/master/OOP)\n",
